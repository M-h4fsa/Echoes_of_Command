🎓 Lecture: Four Pillars of Allied Leadership in WWII –
Stalin, Churchill, de Gaulle, and Roosevelt

📘 Introduction
World War II (1939–1945) was more than a war of armies
and ideologies—it was a moment of destiny achieved
through exceptional leaders.

Four great leaders headed the Allied powers: the Soviet
Union's Joseph Stalin, the United Kingdom's Winston
Churchill, Free France's Charles de Gaulle, and the
United States' Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Each led their nations through war and left an
indelible legacy. This lecture explores their
personal histories, leadership, choices, and impact.

🛡️ Joseph Stalin: The Iron Leader of the East

After Lenin's death in 1924, Stalin seized power,
ruling with repression and forced collectivization.
He turned the USSR into an industrial power under
strict control.

In 1939, Stalin shocked the world by signing a pact
with Hitler. But in 1941, Hitler invaded the USSR.
Stalin led fierce resistance, turning the tide at
Stalingrad.

Stalin demanded total loyalty and vast mobilization.
He was unyielding in negotiations, securing Soviet
dominance over Eastern Europe.

🗣️ Winston Churchill: The Voice of Defiance

“Iron Curtain.”

After France's defeat, de Gaulle fled to Britain and
broadcasted the Appeal of 18 June, urging resistance.

De Gaulle united resistance groups and led Free
French Forces. Often sidelined, he fought for
France’s dignity and place in victory.

and later founded the Fifth Republic in 1958—becoming
a symbol of French independence.

Elected in 1933, Roosevelt focused on the Great
Depression but supported democratic ideals
internationally.

Before Pearl Harbor, he backed the Allies with
Lend-Lease. The 1941 attack brought the U.S. into
the war.

helping plan D-Day and shaping Allied strategy.
Tehran and Yalta set the post-war path.
